            <strong>Physical Examination, X-Rays, Biopsy, and Early CT Scans</strong><br/>
            In the past, identifying benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors was less 
            accurate and relied mainly on manual exams and basic imaging techniques such as physical examination.
             Doctors would palpate areas of the body to feel for lumps or abnormal growths. 
             This method was useful for detecting tumors near the surface but had limitations in identifying 
             internal tumors or distinguishing between benign and malignant ones.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-4">
            X-rays, introduced in the early 20th century, became one of the first tools for viewing 
            the inside of the body. They helped doctors spot abnormal growths, especially in bones or 
            dense tissues. However, X-rays provided only basic images and couldnâ€™t differentiate between benign 
            and malignant tumors due to the lack of detail in the images.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-4">
            Once a suspicious tumor was identified through a physical exam or X-ray, a biopsy was usually performed. 
            A biopsy involves removing a tissue sample to examine it under a microscope to determine whether 
            it is benign or malignant. Although this method was reliable, it often required invasive surgery, 
            leading to delays in diagnosis.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-4">
            In the 1970s, the invention of computed tomography (CT) scans marked a significant step forward. 
            CT scans offered cross-sectional images of the body, giving much more detailed information than X-rays.
            Doctors could better identify tumors, including their size, shape, and location.
            However, even with CT scans, determining if a tumor was benign or malignant still often required a
            biopsy or further testing.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Challenges</strong> <br/>
            Early detection methods for tumors presented several challenges. 
            One of the major difficulties was distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. 
            Older techniques often lacked the ability to make this distinction, 
            leading to the need for biopsies or surgeries to confirm a diagnosis. 
            Additionally, early imaging technologies like X-rays and initial CT scans did not provide the 
            detailed images that modern equipment now offers. This lack of clarity made it harder to detect
            small or internal tumors and accurately assess their characteristics. 
            Furthermore, many diagnostic procedures, such as biopsies, involved invasive surgeries, 
            which could be both painful and time-consuming for patients.
